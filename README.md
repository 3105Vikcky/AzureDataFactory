This is Azure Data Factory-related practice. 
Here I have created:
1. Pipeline for copying data Activity from the source to the sink.
2. Created Integration Runtime:
            a) Azure Integration Runtime.
            b) Self-Hosted Integration Runtime.
            c) SSIS Integration Runtime.
3. Want to create a data flow to transform the data?
